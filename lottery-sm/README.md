# PROVEABLY RANDOM RAFFLE CONTRACTS

## ABOUT

This code is to create a proveably random smart contract lottery.

## What we want it to do?
1. Users can enter by paying for a ticket.
    - The ticket fees are going to go to the winner during the draw.
2. After X period of time, the lottery will automatically draw a winner.
   - This will be done programmatically.
3. Using Chainlink VRF & Chainlink Automation
    - Chainlink VRF -> Randomness
    - Chainlink Automation -> Time based trigger
